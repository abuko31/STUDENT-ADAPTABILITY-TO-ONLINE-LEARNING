# STUDENT-ADAPTABILITY-TO-ONLINE-LEARNING
With the unexpected breakout of COVID-19 in 2020 came the need to improve online systems in virtually every sector that involves physical human interaction, which includes the education sector.  Having more educational institutions providing online options has had many benefits, such as saving on transportation costs and removing location as a barrier to accessing a program, to name a few. A survey undertaken by Wiley Education Services showed that 85% of students liked the flexibility of online learning. Despite these benefits, online learning has its challenges, such as power outages and lack of good internet connection. There are therefore factors that influence whether a student adapts well to an online program, and our study aims to analyze some of these factors.
